and the right of journalists to dig up embarrassing secrets without fear of being imprisoned", "Faced with the backlash, the Guardian quickly – and very quietly – rowed back its initial certainty that its story was based on verified facts.\nInstead, it amended the text, without acknowledging it had done so, to attribute the claims to unnamed, and uncheckable, “sources", "The Guardian’s latest story provides a supposedly stronger foundation for an existing narrative: that Assange and Wikileaks knowingly published emails hacked by Russia from the Democratic party’s servers.\nIn truth, there is no public evidence that the emails were hacked, or that Russia was involved.\nCentral actors have suggested instead that the emails were leaked from within the Democratic party", "Even when a United Nations panel of experts in international law ruled in 2016 that Assange was being arbitrarily – and unlawfully – detained by the UK, Guardian writers led efforts to discredit the UN report", "The problem for the Guardian, which should have been obvious to its editors from the outset, is that any visits by Manafort would be easily verifiable without relying on unnamed “sources", "In fact, the Guardian obtained the embassy’s logs in May, and has never made any mention of either Manafort or “Russians” being identified in them.\nIt did not refer to the logs in its latest story", "No fact-checking\nIt is worth noting it should be vitally important for a serious publication like the Guardian to ensure its claims are unassailably true – both because Assange’s personal fate rests on their veracity, and because, even more importantly, a fundamental right, the freedom of the press, is at stake", "Given this, one would have expected the Guardian’s editors to have insisted on the most stringent checks imaginable before going to press with Harding’s story.\nAt a very minimum, they should have sought out a response from Assange and Manafort before publication.\nNeither precaution was taken", "And yet this piece seems to have been casually waved through, given a green light even though its profound shortcomings were evident to a range of well-placed analysts and journalists from the outset", "Despite all this, even analysts critical of the Guardian’s behaviour have shown a glaring failure to understand that its latest coverage represents not an aberration by the paper but decisively fits with a pattern", "It was also apparently evidence of the paper’s clickbait tendencies", "They [Guardian editors] knew that publishing this story would cause partisan warriors to excitedly spread the story, and that cable news outlets would hyperventilate over it, and that they’d reap the rewards regardless of whether the story turned out to be true or false", "Rather than being the reason for the Guardian violating basic journalistic standards and ethics, the paper’s hatred of Assange is a symptom of a deeper malaise in the Guardian and the wider corporate media", "Even aside from its decade-long campaign against Assange, the Guardian is far from “solid and reliable”, as Greenwald claims.\nIt has been at the forefront of the relentless, and unhinged, attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for prioritising the rights of Palestinians over Israel’s right to continue its belligerent occupation.\nOver the past three years, the Guardian has injected credibility into the Israel lobby’s desperate efforts to tar Corbyn as an anti-semite", "Similarly, the Guardian worked tirelessly to promote Clinton and undermine Sanders in the 2016 Democratic nomination process – another reason the paper has been so assiduous in promoting the idea that Assange, aided by Russia, was determined to promote Trump over Clinton for the presidency", "The Guardian’s coverage of Latin America, especially of populist leftwing governments that have rebelled against traditional and oppressive US hegemony in the region, has long grated with analysts and experts.\nIts especial venom has been reserved for leftwing figures like Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez, democratically elected but official enemies of the US, rather than the region’s rightwing authoritarians beloved of Washington", "The Guardian has been vocal in the so-called “fake news” hysteria, decrying the influence of social media, the only place where leftwing dissidents have managed to find a small foothold to promote their politics and counter the corporate media narrative", "Equally, the Guardian has made clear who its true heroes are.\nCertainly not Corbyn or Assange, who threaten to disrupt the entrenched neoliberal order that is hurtling us towards climate breakdown and economic collapse.\nIts pages, however, are readily available to the latest effort to prop up the status quo from Tony Blair, the man who led Britain, on false pretences, into the largest crime against humanity in living memory – the attack on Iraq", "The Guardian has painted social media chiefly as a platform overrun by Russian trolls, arguing that this should justify ever-tighter restrictions that have so far curbed critical voices of the dissident left more than the right", "That “humanitarian intervention” cost the lives of many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and created a vacuum that destabilised much of the Middle East, sucked in Islamic jihadists like al-Qaeda and ISIS, and contributed to the migrant crisis in Europe that has fuelled the resurgence of the far-right.\nNone of that is discussed in the Guardian or considered grounds for disqualifying Blair as an arbiter of what is good for Britain and the world’s future", "The Guardian also has an especial soft spot for blogger Elliot Higgins, who, aided by the Guardian, has shot to unlikely prominence as a self-styled “weapons expert”.\nLike Luke Harding, Higgins invariably seems ready to echo whatever the British and American security services need verifying “independently", "Higgins and his well-staffed website Bellingcat have taken on for themselves the role of arbiters of truth on many foreign affairs issues, taking a prominent role in advocating for narratives that promote US and NATO hegemony while demonising Russia, especially in highly contested arenas such as Syria", "Improbably, the Guardian has adopted Higgins as the poster-boy for a supposed citizen journalism it has sought to undermine as “fake news” whenever it occurs on social media without the endorsement of state-backed organisations", "The truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange, or in its much longer-running campaign to vilify him.\nWith this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake – it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative", "Reporter Luke Harding’s latest article, claiming that Donald Trump’s disgraced former campaign manager Paul Manafort secretly visited Assange in Ecuador’s embassy in London on three occasions, is so full of holes that even hardened opponents of Assange in the corporate media are struggling to stand by it", "The propaganda function of the piece is patent", "This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted", "The story was weakly sourced and included some details that seemed unlikely to be true", "Unfortunately no western main stream media can any longer be trusted to publish the truth", "This defensive Guardian claim is, like its story, evidently completely false.\nWikileaks publicly denied the Guardian's claims 90 minutes before the story was first published.\nManafort asserts that his lawyers had notified the Guardian that the story was false before the Guardian 'proceeded with the story", "The story was completely false and the Guardian knew it was.\nIt disregarded and left out the denials the subjects of the story had issued before it was published", "The Guardian has become a main outlet for British government disinformation operations aimed at defaming Russia.\nIt smeared Assange and Snowden as Russian collaborators.\nIt uncritically peddled the Russiagate story and the nonsensical Skripal claims which are both obviously concocted by British intelligence services.\nThat seems to have become its main purpose", "This Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted", "While it earlier made attempts to balance its shoddier side with some interesting reporting, it is now solidly main stream in the worst sense.\nIt promotes neo-liberalism and a delves into cranky identity grievances stories.\nIt also became an main outlet for manipulative propaganda peddled by the British secret services", "In letter today to Assange's lawyers, Guardian's Luke Harding, winner of Private Eye's Plagiarist of the Year, falsely claims jailed former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had secret meetings with Assange in 2013, 2015 and 2016 in story Guardian are \"planning to run", "But several people who had followed the Russiagate fairytale and the Mueller investigation were immediately suspicious of the Guardian claim", "In sum, the Guardian published a story today that it knew would explode into all sorts of viral benefits for the paper and its reporters even though there are gaping holes and highly sketchy aspects to the story", "Moreover, the main author of the story, Luke Harding, is known to be a notorious fraud, a russo-phobe intelligence asset with a personal grievance towards Assange and Wikileaks", "Take for example Luke Harding of the Guardian who just published a book titled Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win.\nHe was taken apart in a Real News interview (vid) about the book.\nThe interviewer pointed out that there is absolutely no evidence in the book to support its claims.\nWhen asked for any proof for his assertion Harding defensively says that he is just \"storytelling\" - in other words: it is fiction.\nHarding earlier wrote a book about Edward Snowden which was a similar sham.\nJulian Assange called it \"a hack job in the purest sense of the term\".\nHarding is also known as plagiarizer.\nWhen he worked in Moscow he copied stories and passages from the now defunct Exile, run by Matt Taibbi and Mark Ames.\nThe Guardian had to publish an apology", "The new Guardian story looked like another weak attempt to connect the alleged Russian malfeasance with Assange and the Wikileaks publishing of the DNC emails.\nAssange and other involved people deny that such a relation existed.\nThere is no public evidence that support such claims", "While most readers with functional critical thinking capacity may readily dismiss the Guardian’s smear on its face, the fact that the Guardian published this piece, and that Luke Harding is still operating with even the tiniest modicum of respect as a journalist despite his history of deceit, tells us something bone-chilling about journalism", "With this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake – it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative", "We have previously shown that the Guardian even uses fascist propaganda tropes to smear the Russian people.\nIt is openly publishing Goebbels' cartoons and rhetoric against Europes biggest state.\nThere is no longer any line that it does not dare to cross.\nUnfortunately other 'western' media are not much better", "Politico allowed \"a former CIA officer,\" writing under a pen name, to suggest - without any evidence - that the Guardian has been duped - not by its MI5/6 and Ecuadorian spy sources, but by Russian disinformation", "Is it possible someone planted this story as a means to discredit the journalists", "The is zero evidence in the Politico screed that supports its suggestions and claims.\nIt is fake news about a fake news story", "Its recent fake news
